The following commits cannot be applied; they are incompatible with pale moon,
or require work because they depend on features incompatible with pale moon:

 *  85eede1ee2d6349ce2bd4adafe35eb8bdb27b1e1     Add util.iterFrames. 
This commit looks like it should be functional, but strangely is not.
It leads to pale moon acting like pentadactyl isn't enabled.
 *  5eece742e19090649647637420bcfb00c7f6c6e3
Depends on the whole australis rewrite.
